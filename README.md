# 4-in-a-line-AI
 
Players take turns placing a piece on an 8x8 board. The first player to get for in a line (row or column, not diagonal) wins. Its basically a modified version of connect 4 without gravity or diagonals. 

This is an implementation of the game, and an AI agent in C++. 

The AI agent uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta pruning to decide on the best move. Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) is used to reach the best search depth possible within the time limit set by the user. Board states are scored using a heuristic function.
